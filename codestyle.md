## Class definition
Class names should use hump nomenclature starting with a capital letter. For example, PublicClass.

The class definition should be contained in a file with the same name as the class name. For example, the definition of the PublicClass class should be saved in a file named publicclass.java.

The class definition should include an access modifier, usually public, to indicate that the class can be accessed by other classes. If no access modifier is specified, the default is package-private (that is, only classes in the same package can be accessed).

Class definitions can contain class-level variables (called fields) and methods. Fields and methods should also use hump nomenclature, and method names should start with a verb.

Class definitions can contain constructors that initialize instances of the class. The constructor should have the same name as the class name, have no return type, and can initialize fields of the class in it.

If the class definition contains methods, you should provide an appropriate access modifier for each method, such as public, private, protected, or default (package-private). The access modifier for a method should be selected based on the purpose and access requirements of the method.

Class definitions can include comments and documentation so that others can understand the functionality and purpose of the code. Comments should be clear and should be written in JavaDoc format.

## Method definition
In Java, the definition of methods also needs to follow certain specifications, which helps to improve the readability and consistency of the code. Here are some specifications for Java method definitions:

Method naming: Method names should use a hump naming method starting with a lowercase letter. Verbs should be used to express the action of a method. For example, calculateSum().

Access modifiers: Each method should have explicit access modifiers, such as public, private, protected, or default (not specified). This determines where the method can be accessed from.

private: When a member of a class is declared private, it can only be accessed by itself, not by external classes. This is the most restrictive modifier for access.

protected: When a member of a class is declared protected, it can be accessed by itself, other classes in the same package, and subclasses in different packages.

public: A class has the most permissive access when its members are declared public. It can be accessed by any other class, whether they are in the same package or a subclass of that class.

Return type: Methods should explicitly declare their return type. If the method does not return any value, then it should be declared void. The type returned should be as precise as possible, avoiding overly broad types such as Object.

Parameters: The list of parameters for the method should be clear, and the type and name of each parameter should be clear. Parameters should also use the hump nomenclature.

Exception handling: A method should clearly declare any exceptions it may throw. This helps the code calling this method understand possible errors and handle them appropriately.

Comments: Important information about the method should be explained through comments, including the purpose of the method, the meaning of the parameters, and the return value. Comments should be in JavaDoc format.

Method body: The code inside the method body should be concise and clear, avoiding lengthy and complex code. Each method should try to do only one thing, which facilitates code reuse and testing.

## Interface definition
1. **Interface naming**:

Interface names should be descriptive, usually ending in able, ible, or er, e.g. Runnable, Serializable.
Use hump nomenclature that starts with a capital letter, such as PublicInterface.
Avoid using Java keywords as interface names.

2. **Interface location**:

Interfaces should be located where they are accessible to their users. In general, this means that the interface should be placed in a package whose name reflects its purpose.

3. **Method naming**:

An interface method should be a verb or phrasal verb that represents an operation, such as start(), stop().
Methods should also use hump naming and start with a lowercase letter, such as public void myMethod(); .

4. **Note**:

Annotate the interfaces and their methods sufficiently so that other developers can understand their purpose.
Annotate using the JavaDoc format so that the API documentation can be generated by the tool.

5. **interface and implementation separation**:

The interface should not contain any specific implementation details. These details should be defined in the class that implements the interface.

6. **Avoid being too big**:

Avoid creating too large an interface, and the number of methods in the interface should be moderate. Too large an interface can make the implementation class complex and difficult to understand.

7. **Constant definition**:

If the interface needs to define constants, then these constants should be public, static, and final. Usually these constants are uppercase letters, with underscores separating words, for example: public static final String CONSTANT_NAME = "value";

8. **Default method and static method**:

Where appropriate, you can use both default and static methods. Default methods can add new methods to an interface without breaking an existing implementation, while static methods can provide instrumental functions related to the interface.

## Variable definition
1. **Naming specification**:
Use meaningful variable names that clearly express the purpose of the variable.
Use hump naming, with variable names starting with a lowercase letter, such as myVariable.
For variable names that consist of multiple words, use the hump naming method, such as mySecondVariable.
2. **Type specification**:
Use appropriate data types to avoid unnecessary data type conversions and wasted memory.
Where possible, use primitive data types in preference to their wrapper classes.
3. **Constant specification**:
Constants are usually defined using the static and final keywords.
Constant names are all capitalized, with underscores separating words, such as MY_CONSTANT.
Constants should not be changed, so they should be initialized when defined.

## Static keyword
1. **Static variables** (class variables) :
Variables that are modified with static are called static variables or class variables.
It belongs to the class, not to any instance of the class. That is, all instances of the class share the same static variable.
Static variables are initialized at class load time and memory is allocated only once at class load time.
2. **Static methods** (class methods) :
Methods that use static modification are called static methods or class methods.
Static methods can be called directly by the class name without creating an instance of the class.
A static method can access a static data member and can change the value of a static data member.
